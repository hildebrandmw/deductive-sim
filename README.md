## Deductive Simulator for Combinational Circuits
Final Project for EEC283

Main source code is found in "src/simulator.jl".

Circuits can be found in the "circuits" directory while test vectors used
to obtain results are found in the "tests" directory.

File "scratch.jl" is just used by me in Atom to perform function evaluations.
